## First Feature:
Find the location of the domain of an email address

Output: Finds the domain of the email and find itâ€™s IP address (using socket library).
and then find the location of the ip using the first API.
			
## Second Feature:

We are using the second API to check if the domain of the email address from the user exist.
This is one of the criterions for a valid email.

# CICD:
In this project we set out to manage our workflow with a CI platfrom, we used CircleCI and
configured a workflow for the building&linting&testing of our project prior to the deployment on a
cloud storage hosting site, in this case [sce-api-testing@heroku](https://sce-api-testing.herokuapp.com/).

## Conversion of MD markdown to static HTML:
we used npm's [showdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown) for the conversion and created
and configured a script that will deploy the updated readme's static html to heroku in our CI
platform's workflow.
